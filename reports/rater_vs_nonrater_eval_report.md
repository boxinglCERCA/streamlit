This report summarizes the comparative evaluation between the **RATER-enhanced model** and the **Non-RATER (baseline) model** for identifying and giving feedback on claim and evidence sentences in student responses.

## 1. Preference Counts Summary

### üó£Ô∏è Claim Sentence Preferences

| Model           | Preferred Count |
|----------------|------------------|
| **RATER**       | 121              |
| Non-RATER       | 82               |
| No Preference   | 16               |

RATER-enhanced feedback on claims was preferred in a majority of cases, suggesting its improvements are especially evident when identifying key argumentative components„Äê54‚Ä†source„Äë.

### üìö Evidence Sentence Preferences

| Model           | Preferred Count |
|----------------|------------------|
| **RATER**       | 110              |
| Non-RATER       | 104              |
| No Preference   | 5                |

Evaluator preference for evidence feedback was nearly evenly split, but RATER showed slight overall favor, particularly when better surfacing relevant supporting content„Äê54‚Ä†source„Äë.

### ‚úÖ Overall Model Preference

| Model           | Preferred Count |
|----------------|------------------|
| **RATER**       | 99               |
| Non-RATER       | 96               |
| No Preference   | 24               |

The close split reflects the strength of the baseline system, while also affirming that RATER provides meaningful, if modest, improvements„Äê54‚Ä†source„Äë.

## 4. Observations & Key Insights

### üîç Claim Identification
- RATER-enhanced outputs were more often accurate in grades 8 and 11.
- In some lower grades (6, 7), Non-RATER produced equally or more helpful feedback.
- The improvements in higher grades suggest RATER is more effective at handling complexity.

### üìñ Evidence Support
- Gains from RATER are more evident in grades 7, 8, and 10.
- In grade 9, Non-RATER‚Äôs evidence selection slightly outperformed RATER.

## 5. Improvements to RATER Scoring Logic

Recent changes based on evaluation findings:

- **Feedback Precision**: Emphasis on clarifying vague themes and rating missing structures conservatively.
- **Narrative Element Recognition**: Enhanced detection for missing dialogue, transitions, and conclusions.
- **Audience Engagement**: Reduced harshness in scoring clear, readable prose‚Äîespecially in Grades 3‚Äì5.

These updates align with insights from the narrative scoring analysis, where over-penalization of readable writing and lack of structure detection were common issues„Äê55‚Ä†source„Äë.

## 6. Conclusion

The RATER-enhanced model demonstrates **consistent or superior performance** across most grades, particularly in handling subtle or complex writing. Its improvements in feedback clarity and evidence selection suggest value in high-stakes or growth-focused writing environments.

While the Non-RATER system remains strong and competitive, the **RATER model offers incremental but meaningful benefits** in both scoring accuracy and actionable feedback quality.
